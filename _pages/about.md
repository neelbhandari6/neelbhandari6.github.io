<!-- Hello! I am a Masters student at Carnegie Mellon University's Language Technologies Institute, where I'll be specialisaing in the areas of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. \ -->

Prior to joining CMU, I spent two fantastic years at PayPal as a Machine Learning Scientist. There, I developed PayPal's first automated root cause identification tool, which extracts root causes and problem statements from millions of customer chat transcripts. I was also part of the team that worked on the first LLM-based PayPal Assistant chatbot.

My research has focused on multilingual NLP and robustness. I contributed to the [Aya Project](https://cohere.com/research/aya), where we developed a state-of-the-art multilingual model covering 100 languages (We won [Best Paper at ACL 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07827)!). My specific contributions included efficient data pruning and pipelining to create an accessible model. Additionally, I collaborated with [Dr. Pin-Yu Chen](https://sites.google.com/site/pinyuchenpage/home) at the [MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/), studying the robustness of text-based adversarial attacks from a multilingual lens.
