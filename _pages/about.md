<!-- Hello! I am a Masters student at Carnegie Mellon University's Language Technologies Institute, where I'll be specialisaing in the areas of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. \ -->

Prior to joining CMU, I spent a fantastic 2 years at PayPal as a Machine Learning Scientist. I built PayPal's first automated root cause identification tool, which could extract root causes and problem statements across millions of customer chat transcripts. I was also part of the team working on the first LLM-based PayPal Assistant chatbot. \

My research has spanned across multilingual NLP and robustness. I worked on the Aya Project, where we built a state-of-the-art multilingual model spanning 100 languages (We won Best Paper at ACL 2024!). I specifically worked on efficient data pruning and pipelining to develop an accessible model. I have also worked with Dr. Pin-Yu Chen at the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, studying the robustness of text adversarial attacks in the multilingual space.
